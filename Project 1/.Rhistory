#C -  Background infromation
#In June, the Maryland Hospitals Association established EDDIE, the Emergency Department Dramatic Improvements Effort, to address hospital wait times in the state. By having each hospital set objectives for lowering emergency department wait times and discharges, EDDIE aims to put Maryland hospitals back on target with the rest of the country. Now, the state has one of the highest average wait times in the country. EDDIE has been collecting monthly data on each Maryland hospital’s average wait times, and I have that data from July through January, provided by a request to the Maryland Hospital Association.
#The data provided by the MHA is fairly large and consists of numerous variables.
#In the file, the following sheets are available: EDDIE All Data, ED1a, ED1b, ED1c, OP18a, OP18b, OP18c, ED1a Volume, ED1b Volume, ED1c Volume, OP18a Volume, OP18b Volume, OP18c Volume
#The Volume sheets refer to the volume of visitors to the hospital.
#ED1 refers to emergency department "arrival to inpatient admission time" and OP refers to outpatients who are discharged into the community for "outpatient ED arrival to discharge time" according to Damiara Smith, a quality fellow for the MHA cost review commission.
#ED1b/OP18b refer to non-psych patients, while ED1c/OP18c refer to psychiatric patients.
#ED1a/OP18a refer to all patients.
#For this project, I have chosen to analyze the ED1a columns to measure hospital patient arrival to emergency department admission on a general basis for all patients, as opposed to psych or non-psych.
#D - Add research questions here
#1. What hospitals in Maryland are seeing the most and least improvement?
#1a. Which 5 hospitals had the lowest percent change since base month?
#1b. How many hospitals have had increasing wait times from their base month to January? Which 5 have had the biggest increases?
#2. What does each hospital's month over month look like?
